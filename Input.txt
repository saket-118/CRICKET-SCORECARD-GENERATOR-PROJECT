0.5
.
Thomas to S Dhawan, no run
Beaten by a ripper! Banged in short, angling away, Dhawan looks to upper cut but is beaten for pace and cramped for room. West Indies opt for a review. And they lose it. No deviation, which means no spike. The review was Pooran's alone, even though the bowler wasn't convinced.

Brathwaite to S Dhawan, FOUR runs
Deflected gently past short third man. Used the pace very nicely. Dhawan's go-to stroke for boundaries have all been behind the wicket today. Not surprising considering he's struggled a bit for timing, perhaps a consequence of easing himself back into international cricket after an injury

He's steered it straight to third man! Short ball outside off, just below the shoulder, seemed to be caught in two minds on what to do with it, and ended up top-edging an attempted glide. Good pace on the ball from Oshane, and it carries straight to Pollard on the boundary. That's that for Pant then

Rishabh Pant c Pollard b Thomas 4 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80

Back of a length, Pandey was backing away expecting a short one again, but this one was well bowled and seamed in, he ends up jabbing it into the offside

And back to the short ball, Kohli connects well with the pull, pleasing sound off the bat. Didn't try to hit too hard though and there is protection at deep midwicket

Expansive extra cover drive, but Cottrell had taken the pace off a bit so Kohli had to manufacture his own. The placement was good though, so they pick up two. Quick running

Cottrell to Kohli, OUT
It's time for the Cottrell salute. Perfectly executed yorker on middle stump, Kohli wanted to whip that through the on side, but the ball snakes under and sends the stump cartwheeling. And Cottrell's doing his thing of course

He's sticking to that full line aiming for the yorkers. Doesn't quite nail it then, but Krunal isn't sure of the pace, which Cottrell is varying well. Ends up wristing it towards square leg

Length ball, dug into the pitch and grips a bit, in the channel. Pushed towards cover

17.2
2

Goes for the yorker, but ends up as a low full toss. The late movement in the air defeats his attempted flick, and it takes a thick leading edge to go to deep extra cover

Paul to Krunal, 1 run
Lost control of that one, ends up as a high full toss, he takes his top hand off the bat and jabs it to long-off

17.4
1
Paul to Pandey, 1 run
Dug in short of a length, but it's from the spot in the pitch where there isn't much bounce, and Keemo's probably taking the pace off as well. Pandey has to wait for it and then slobbers it to deep midwicket

17.5

Fuller on off, in the slot and driven to long-off with a big swing of the bat. Not timed perfectly though

Cottrell to Pandey, OUT
Got him! wonderful by Cottrell. Pandey tried something different by dancing down the track, and Cottrell put some shoulder into it and bowled it short. It ends up getting big on Pandey, whose attempted pull only results in a top edge that is smartly held over his head by the keeper

Manish Pandey c †Pooran b Cottrell 6 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75

18.5
1lb
Cottrell to Jadeja, 1 leg bye
Run out chance missed by the keeper. Jadeja misses the flick and it trickles to the keeper. They set off for a run, and the keeper lines up and has a shy - if he had hit, Krunal was miles out

19.5

Paul to Jadeja, SIX runs
Nailed it! What a finish this turning out to be. Keemo misses his length again, full toss on the stumps and Jadeja's powerful forearms send the ball soaring just over the deep midwicket fence. Hit the rope on the full in fact, bisecting long-on and deep square

19.6
1
Paul to Jadeja, 1 run
Wide yorker again and well executed that time, Jadeja can only flat bat it to mid-off. But it's been a fantastic final over for India
